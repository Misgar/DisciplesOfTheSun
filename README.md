# DisciplesOfTheSun
The very first Unity project we made.

Well.. That's basically it.
Disciples of The Sun Demo is a 1.5 year project (Term Paper), that we decided to develop.. cuz we are kinda of a crazy group.
We want to achieve a playable 3D game that focus on the environment, and demonstrate some of the engine (Unity 3D) features. 
We specially want to show that 1.5 year is enough time to develop a impressive "showcase demo" if you and your friends are not normal people.

Hope you enjoy it once is released! :)
